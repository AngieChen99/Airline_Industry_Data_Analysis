# Airline_Industry_Maketing_Analysis

# Intro
The US has the largest air travel market in the world, with more than 900 million passengers being transported each year. It has already become a vital part of peopleâ€™s everyday life. However, the airline industry is stuck in a dilemma these days with the unleashing chaos brought by the pandemic across the global market as well as the multiple cycles of financial success and failures. In the recent decade, the airline industry experienced financial challenges from the fuel cost and the concern from the restructuring and mergers. To tell the full story, our team will explore the airline industry dataset to analyze its operating environment and then make recommendations based on its financial health and prospects.

# Hypothesis

Airlines provide vital services by generating economic growth, creating jobs, and facilitating international tourism. However, because of lower airfare prices from carriers, bloated cost structures, and poor service reputation, the airline industry faces difficulties maintaining consistent profits. To address these problems, we will conduct a data analysis to improve decision-making within the industry. The goal of this project is to help increase industry revenue, reduce aircraft cost, and measure overall performance.  
Our team breaks down the problem statement and hypothesis into two key points:

- Revenue and Profit
Problem: The rise of low-cost carriers puts downward pressure on airfare prices.
Hypothesis: Increased baggage fee and cancellation fee will increase airline revenue to sustainable levels.

- Employee compensation and Labor Productivity
Problem: Labor costs go up but productivity doesn't go up at the same rate
Hypothesis: Decrease labor costs to match the productivity.
